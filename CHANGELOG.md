# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.7]
### Fixed
- Downgrade `stac-fastapi.pgstac` dependency from `3.0.1` to `2.5.0` and `pypgstac[psycopg]` dependency from `0.8.6` to `0.7.10`. The [Context extension](https://github.com/stac-api-extensions/context) was deprecated in [stac-fastapi v2.5.0](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi/blob/main/CHANGES.md#250---2024-04-12) and was removed in [stac-fastapi v3.0.0](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi/blob/main/CHANGES.md#300---2024-07-29). Our previous release (v0.3.6) upgraded `stac-fastapi.pgstac` from `2.5.0` to `3.0.1` without removing the Context extension, which causes https://stac.asf.alaska.edu to return `Internal Server Error`.

## [0.3.6]
### Changed
- The [`static-analysis`](.github/workflows/static-analysis.yml) Github Actions workflow now uses `ruff` rather than `flake8` for linting.
